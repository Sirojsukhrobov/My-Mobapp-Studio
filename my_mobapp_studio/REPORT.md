# Objective of the project
Our project goal is to clean given dataset, analyze, visualize the necessary part of data, i.e the number of installs of apps by looking at app info and its reviews and categories. We hope that this project will help app developers predict their number of installs or investors who want to pick out the next big app. Companies may run beta focus groups, or app developers may receive feedback from testers and get certain amounts of reviews. We use this and some knowledge about the app to predict its success. Knowing the number of installs can help developers and business managers because they can predict the profit. This project's result may show the importance of reviews to apps in the market as it could be one of the determining factors for the number of installs.


# Results & Overall
The first thing we see from the plotted graphs is that most of the applications belong to the Family, Game, Medical categories. In addition, the majority of free games are much larger than paid ones, approximately exceeding almost 12 times. 
In addition, we can see that users gave the highest rating of 4.5, which was obvious at the beginning.
The bulk of the reviews belong to the Game category, and after it, the Family category lags far behind in this rating.

Further, we see that the minimum rating for all categories belongs to applications of the Entertainment category.
Let's now take a specific category for example Family. You can see the most popular applications in the project that I have pinned in my GitHub account.

And as for genres, we can see that games that develop mental capacity have more popularity.
Therefore, games have a large number of installations among other categories.

Let's move on to paid apps now.
The highest average price among app categories goes to Finance. After him LifeStyle, Medical.
The most expensive apps are in the Family, Lifestyle, and Finance categories.
